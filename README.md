## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Overall the project was easy. It did not require high-level CSS. I completed this project by using the basics of CSS. Well, I have been using CSS custom properties for a while, and I love to use them. It reduces my work a lot.

````css
:root {
  /* Colors */
  --color-primary-900: hsl(233, 47%, 7%); /* main background*/
  --color-primary-800: hsl(244, 38%, 16%); /* card background*/
  --color-primary-700: hsl(277, 64%, 61%); /* accent*/

  --color-neuteal-300: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /* main heading , stats*/
  --color-neuteal-200: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75); /* main paragraph*/
  --color-neuteal-100: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6); /* stat headings*/

  /* Font Family */
  --ff-primary: "Inter", sans-serif;
  --ff-secondary: "Lexend Deca", sans-serif;

  /* Font Sizes */
  --fs-primary: 13px;
  --fs-large: 24px;

  /* Font Weights */
  --fw-regular: 400;
  --fw-bold: 700;
}
````

### Continued development

The use of CSS custom properties is very vast. I will refine the use of this technique and will use it more elegantly.
